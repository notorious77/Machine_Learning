## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cache=TRUE}
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(ROCR)
library(e1071)
library(randomForest)
#source("performance_plot_utils.R")
train<-read.csv("pml-training.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
test<-read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
#str(test)
#str(train)

clean_train<- train[, colSums(is.na(train)) == 0]
trainData <- clean_train[, -c(1:7)]
#fit<-caret::train(classe~., method = "rpart", data = clean_train)
summary(trainData)

set.seed(7777)
trainPart<-createDataPartition(trainData$classe, p = .7, list = FALSE)

training<-trainData[trainPart,]
validData<-trainData[-trainPart,]


cont<-trainControl(method = "cv", number = 7)

fit0<-train(classe~.,  data = training, method = "rf", trControl = cont)

importance<-varImp(fit0, scale = FALSE)
#plot(importance,top=10)
#summary(fit0)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
